<p>This blog should be a place where I can document tech tips based on my study and everyday experience.</p>
<p>At some point, I understood that I have the information documented at different places like Telegram saved messages, Markdown documents, txt files, and some important information was never documented. So I decided to create a blog, where I can describe what I do or what I learned.</p>
<p>The website is built with <a target="_blank" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll">Mediumish <i class="fab fa-github"></i></a> template for Jekyll.</p>
